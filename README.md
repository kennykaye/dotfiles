Installation
------------

**NOTE:** Currently there is no management of global dependencies. This will
make installing this difficult for you. Instead I recommend that you look
through the configurations and cherry-pick what is appropriate to your setup.

If you still would like to install this whole-sale, you will need to first
resolve dependencies using `brew` or `apt-get`.

Once that's done, run `./install` to automatically set up the configurations

After install is completed, open vim and run `:PlugInstall`
